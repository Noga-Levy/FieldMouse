# Field Mouse #
Whether it is due to an accident, genetic defect, or another reason, many people around the world encounter difficulties using their hands--if they can, at all. Furthermore, with one's hands being the gateway to the internet, it can render what is supposed to be the great connector into the great isolator.

Enter Field Mouse.

Using the movements of one's eyes, Field Mouse, once completed, will allow the user to control their mouse by simply looking at the area they wish to send their mouse to.

The best part? **No expensive hardware necessary**--just the computer's webcam.

## Installation / End Functional ##
When the project is complete, the plan is to put the code into an app, allowing for a simpler installation. This may change, though.
So far, the idea for the commands is:

| Button | Action |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Right Click | Right eye wink |
| Left Click | Left eye wink |
| Move | Look at the end point |
| End Program | Close both eyes for 5 seconds |

THIS MAY BE SUBJECT TO CHANGE

## Plan ##
1. Get blink detection for the left and right eyes.
2. Connect the blink detection to the left and right clicks (using PyAutoGUI).
3. Get the "End Program" ability.
4. Get the eye fixations.
5. Connect eye fixation to mouse movement.
6. Add UI.

Completion date: TBD
